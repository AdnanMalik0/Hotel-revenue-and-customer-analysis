The following work was done in order to understand - through in-depth analysis of Hotel's revenue data - their performance, strength and weaknesses. And based on the analysis and understanding, a PowerBI dashboard was built which can help in devising future plans and best practices for the Hotels.

## Areas explored (_Questions tried to answer_)

9. Exploring discounts given to Market-segments.

  Each Market-segment is entitled to a discount on their reservation except those which are "Undefined". To understand how much overall discount is being given to each segment - for the given time span - and compare it with the revenue earned from these segments allows us to differentiate the more profiting market-segment to the least for the Hotel.

10. Revenue from Meals provided, based on the type of meals offered by the hotel.

11. Customer's Nationalities. Knowing from where majority customers belong to.

  Analysing the most common nationality among the Guests will help us in building profiting strategies which may help us to accomodate different cultures, make them feel comfortable, thus allowing the customers to stick with the Hotels for long.
